# remote-sensing-portfolio

This repository contains selected examples of my work in remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and data engineering for environmental applications.

My background is in applied environmental science and remote sensing, with experience building reproducible workflows for processing large satellite and raster datasets (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel), developing NDVI composites, cloud masking approaches, and scalable geospatial pipelines using R, and Google Earth Engine.
